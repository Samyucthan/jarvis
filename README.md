# jarvis
Jarvis, inspired by the fictional AI from Iron Man, is a voice-activated assistant that leverages automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to understand and execute user commands. ASR is the technology that enables Jarvis to convert spoken words into text, allowing it to interpret user requests.
